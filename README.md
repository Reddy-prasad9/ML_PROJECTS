 During the House Price Prediction project, I focused on developing a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. Initially, I collected and preprocessed historical house price data to ensure completeness and consistency. In the feature engineering phase, I created new features from existing data, like price per square foot, and one-hot encoded categorical variables such as neighborhood and property type. I experimented with different regression algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting, and used techniques like grid search and cross-validation to fine-tune model parameters. The data was split into training and validation sets to assess model performance and prevent overfitting. Finally, I evaluated the models using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R-squared, achieving a high level of accuracy in predicting house prices. The robust model I developed can now be used by real estate professionals to estimate property values with confidence.
